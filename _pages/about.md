I'm a theoretical physicist studying quantum information and quantum gravity in Professor [Raphael Bousso's group][lightsheet]. 
Most recently, I've been fascinated by thinking about how to use quantum computing to study aspects of black holes. I am also excited by taking ideas from quantum gravity and seeing what they can teach us about quantum information more generally. I'm grateful to have received support from the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program][grfp] and the [DOE Office of Science Graduate Student Research Fellowship][scgsr].

Previously, I was at Stanford where I studied theoretical physics and computer science. While I was there, I did research at the intersection of machine learning and cosmology under Professor [Risa Wechsler][risa], interned at [Google][google], co-taught "Python for Scientists", and led the tutoring team at the [Center for Teaching and Learning][ctl].


In my free time, I enjoy taking [photographs][portfolio], playing [frisbee][ugmo], and tweaking my [text editor][doom] config.
